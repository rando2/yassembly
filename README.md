Scripts for a collaboration on identifying Y-chromosome sequence

This script was uploaded to help a collaborator working on a similar problem. This manuscript is currently in preparation, and the full pipeline for using k-means clustering to identify Y-chromosome sequence in a draft genome will be uploaded as part of the submission process (April 2019). Stay tuned!
